# Data-Analyses


Websites experience all kinds of visitor traffic. This traffic can be monitored and the triggers can be set to classify the traffic into their specific channels, for instance Google analytics is used to generate the kind of data that is avalable in the csv file.

I tried to analyse this data and find out if there are any obvious trends available in the data set. I have also tried to reflect and draw conclusions based on my findings.

Note - The data used here is for a website that is an online repository of books.
