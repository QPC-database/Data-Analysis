# Data-Analysis


Websites experience all kinds of visitor traffic. This traffic can be monitored and the triggers can be set to classify the traffic into their specific channels, for instance Google analytics is used to generate the kind of data that is avalable in the csv file.

I tried to analyse this data and find out if there are any obvious trends available in the data set. I have also tried to reflect and draw conclusions based on my findings.

Note - The data used here is for a website that is an online repository of books.

## Update - Task_take_2 

I have added another file where I have explored some other aspects of the same dataset.
In the file Task_take_2 you may find some visualizations that are not loading at startup. In order to see them you may download 
and view the file. Please run all the cells in that case. The visualisation library used, Plotly, has this feature which has an issue 
with not trusting the notebook when played in an environment other than where it was developed.

Note - Pardon the messy code. I am still working on the code to make it more readable.

Your feedback would be highly appreciated.

Thank you for your time.
